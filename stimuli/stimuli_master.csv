Prime Minister, Kim Hyun Jin said that the increasing debts South Korea had accumulated was not something that happened overnight. It was mentioned that the Government had been giving out monetary incentives to young and unemployed citizens and small business owners during the Covid-19 period. These incentives were used to help the citizens in need to tide over the difficult times. However, after investigations, it was found that some business owners had been giving untrue ledgers. They declared less income than they supposedly generated, so as to be eligible for the grants. According to investigations, the total amount that was wrongfully given to small business owners was a whooping 1000 billion Korean Won.","South Korea's debts had been increasing, which led to a net negative of economic growth during the Covid-19 period.

Well, this might soon become a worry of the past. Researchers at A*Star have recently developed a new self-growing tissue technology, so that you would never need to worry about running out of tissue again! Motivated by the worldwide shortage of tissue paper during the recent covid-19 pandemic, the researchers experimented with different forms of tissue material -- such as bamboo and other fibers -- and made them self-growing and replicating. This is through integrating a form of yeast -- similar to that which makes bread dough expand -- into the tissue fibers' cellular structures. So as you keep the ""mother yeast"" of the tissue at your home, you can be assured to ""harvest"" at least 2 packets' worth of tissue a week.

Firstly, the costs of raw materials used to produce goods and services have been rising rapidly across the globe, ultimately impacting our island state in the form of a higher cost burden falling on consumers. Secondly, export bans placed on major exporters have increased both consumer and producer demand for goods from other smaller exporters, hiking up the prices of these goods in general. Thirdly, political factors such as the Russia-Ukraine War have caused global supply shocks which further contribute to the spike in prices of raw materials used to produce goods.

136,HUMAN,REI,R,E,I,politics,"The Netflix documentary ""Poisoned: The Dirty Truth About Your Food"" has revealed the gruesome lack of regulation related to food products in the United States. The documentary touches on several high-profile outbreaks which have occurred in the last 30 years across the US, such as outbreaks of E. Coli and salmonella in even seemingly safe food products such as hamburgers, peanuts, and lettuce. Shockingly, it is still legal for producers to knowingly sell chicken containing certain strains of salmonella, despite petitions having been made to the USDA and FDA to ban all strains of salmonella from the market. It is also revealed in the film that the lack of a central authority governing food safety in America has created a culture of finger-pointing. In the case of a food-related disease outbreak, there can be no single agency held responsible for the lack of regulation on their part, which leaves room for those at fault to push the blame onto other stakeholders. The federal government has ultimately always pushed the agenda that the burden of food safety falls on consumers to cook their food thoroughly. It can be said that the federal government, as well as federal agencies, neglect pressing issues such as land allocation and agricultural malpractices such as overcrowding and the lack of a set policy on testing that food producers have to do on their products. This has sparked mass outrage amongst victims of food-related disease outbreaks caused by negligence on federal agencies' part, as well as the families of victims who have passed away from such diseases.","The Netflix documentary ""Poisoned: The Dirty Truth About Your Food"" has revealed the gruesome lack of regulation related to food products in the United States.

 Coffee drinkers worldwide have reason to celebrate as reports have indicated a substantial increase in global coffee production. According to the World Coffee Organization, a 20% rise in production was recorded this year, compared to the previous year.
 
 Brazil and Vietnam, two of the world's largest coffee producers, have both reported exceptional harvests, a phenomenon attributed to favorable weather conditions and new sustainable farming techniques. The rise in production is also expected to influence coffee prices in the international market, possibly making your daily cup more affordable.
 
 Experts suggest that this could provide a much-needed relief to the industry, which had been grappling with inconsistent production in the past due to climate change. Many farmers, especially from the African continent, have embraced innovative agricultural practices, contributing to this year's bumper crop.
 
 However, while this increase is welcomed by many, there are concerns about potential market saturation. Distributors and cafe owners are being encouraged to diversify their offerings and explore new coffee-based products.
 
 It remains to be seen how this boost in production will shape the future of the coffee industry, but for now, consumers and producers alike have a reason to be optimistic.","Global Coffee Production Sees a Significant Boost:

 In a bid to enhance food security, Singapore has recently unveiled a series of urban farming initiatives. With land scarcity being a persistent challenge, the city-state has looked towards innovative agricultural methods. Rooftop gardens, vertical farms, and community plots are now increasingly common sights in the urban landscape.
 
 Authorities have identified this move as a strategic approach to reduce dependency on imports. ""Ensuring a stable food supply is crucial for our nation's growth and stability,"" remarked an official spokesperson during the policy announcement. Furthermore, these initiatives have the potential to provide employment opportunities and bring communities closer together.
 
 Additionally, research shows that locally produced food reduces the carbon footprint, resonating with Singapore's commitment to sustainability. This policy, while practical in nature, also fosters a greener and more resilient environment for future generations. As Singapore continues to grow, these urban farming initiatives stand as a testament to its forward-thinking approach to challenges.","Singapore Implements New Urban Farming Initiatives to Boost Local Food Production:
